OR approach for problem solving: 

			this process is a feedback/ we can say bit how iterative.
==> it is flexible , we can revise previous steps if management is not satisfied with sth
in this way we can optimise our results .
==> it is a complete feedback loop/ on-going process.

==================================
1. observation: problem should be observed
2. problem definition:
		problem should be cleared.wrong problem clerance lead to wrong decisions. 

Mathematical model:
==>the set of mathematical equations.
3. Model Construction:
consider a business firm that sells a product. The product costs $5 to produce and sells for 20$
then a model that computes that total profit that will accrue from the items sold is :
     >>   Z=   $20x-$5x    //x is number of items sold. & Z= total profit.
==>   This equation can be called as functional relationship. i.e (Z is function of x)
4. Model Solutions:
==> Once models have been  constructed in management science, they are solved using management 
science techniques.
5. Implementation. TO put something in use/ to actually utilize something
   ==> It is actual use of a model once it has been developed, if this process(implementation) is not done then , the  
efforts and resources used in development will be wasted.


=> OR is "Scienece for better/decision making".
plays role in managerial decision making
=> allows better decisions, better systems, better setups.

===============
Mathematical programming:

Set of mathematical steps written one after another , used to find optimal soltion to a problem.
that describes how to use set of resources in efficient way for better of management.
==>resources impose limitations. e.g hard ware resources have quantity. 10gb,256gb,tc.we can not store more 
than this limit.
==> for a single problem there wil be many solutions, but this not fact that all will be best for us the best of
all will be the that is most/feasible/optimal solution to the mathematical model.


Linear Programming:
   it requires all the mathemtical functions in the mathematical model should be linear in nature.
highestdegree one.
==> programming model: solution technique consists of predetermined steps.that is a program.

Model Formulation: 
  three characteristsics of lP:
   1. decision variable/ unknowns in mathematucal model(MM) / independent variables:     
       ==> defining unknowns
   2. Objective function: => in a LP model reprents objective/goal int terms of desicion variables of a business firm.
   3. model constraints : 

***
Every business firm has some set of resources and these resources have limited quantity.

===========
Model Formulation: Example case study:
  About company , its owner, what they do/produce
  what kind of resources company uses i.e labor,clay but resources are limited as we know, so here it has also 
 restrictions.,company thinking how to get best possible profit(this is objective function) using resoures at
 maximum depending upon avaiablity.
 =====> unit should be used the same as it is given in case study i.e hour,minutes etc.

	step-1:  defining decision variables:
description: since there are 4-gruels to be belended in such a way so as to fulfill the regular diet
	   	, requirements, while minimizing the cost, thereforethe four decision variables 
			represent the proportion of each gruel in 16-ounce can of food.

		let x3 denote proportion of gruel 3 in a 16-ounce can of food
		let x4 denote proportion of gruel 4 in a 16-ounce can of food
we have to make a can in different proportion of each gruel such that sum of all proportions=16
so there can be many possible proportion like: 
Rough: 1 can= 16 ounce
	possibility #1:
	1/4 + 1/4 +1/4 +1/4(1-forth of gruel-4 in 16 ounce) =1 (can)     //1-fourth of 16=>  1/4 x 16= 4 ounces
//->    4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 (16 onces of new can)

	possibility #2:

->    	8 + 4 + 4 + 0=16(new can)
and many more possiblities

Two Depertments: Carpentary dept (total hours= 240), Painting and varnishing dept (total hours=100)
Constructing LP model:
	step-1: identifying decision variables:
		T= let T be the no of tables to be produced per week
		C= let C be the no of chairs to be produced per week

	step2: formulating objective function:
	per table= $70 profit & per chair= $50

	2.T + 1.C <= 100(Painting and varnishing Constraint)
	T,C>=0(Non-negativity Constraint)




Graphical Method For solving LP models:
=========================================
=>easiest way to solve lp model graphically.
=>applicable to models having exact 2 decision variables.
=>provides valuable insight into how other approaches work.
=>non-ve constraints mean that we are always working in the first (or northeast)
	quadrant of a graph.(i.e 1st quadrant)


So the solution space is considered in 1st qudrant bcz of non -ve constraint, that's y technique 
  is restricted upto 2 decision variables.




1/25/2021
========================================================================================

step-1: Plot each constraint as an equation and then decide which side of the line is feasible (if its an inequality.)
step-2: find the feasible region. 
step-3: find the co-ordinates of the corner(extreme) points of the feasible region.
step-4: substitute the corner point coordinates in the objective function. 
step-5: choose the optimal solution.     


step1- Plotting each constraint of LP model as equation on graph:
	Constraint#1: Carpentary Constraint:
		4.T + 3.C <= 240
	after converting it into equality(for plotting it on graph)
		4.T + 3.C =240
step-2: solve for the axis intercepts and draw the line i.e in order to plot this equation on graph
		we need at least two points P1 & P2
Contraint#1:

	to identify point P1, put T=0
		4(0) + 3.C =240
		3.C = 240
		C= 80
		Hence P1(T,C)= (0,80)
	to identify point P2, put C=0
		4.T + 3(0) =240
		4.T = 240
		T= 60
		Hence P1(T,C)= (60,0)



1/27/2021
========================================================================================
continueing previous model solution:
========================================================================================
	we take origin(0,0) as a trial point
=>Take (0,0) as trial point in constraint#1 to identify its feasible region on the graph.
 			4T + 3C  <=240
			0+0 <=240
       			0<=240(constraint is satisfied)
    since point below line(i.e origin) is satisfying the costraint's inequality hence
	feasible region for cons#1 is downward. 


Contraint#2:   Painting and varnishing Constraint
    2T + 1.C <=100
  in equality:
	 2T + 1.C =100

	to identify point P1, put T=0
		2(0) + 1.C =100
		1.C = 100
		C= 100
		Hence P1(T,C)= (0,100)
	to identify point P2, put C=0
		2.T + 1(0) =100
		2.T = 100
		T= 50
		Hence P1(T,C)= (50,0)

Take (0,0) as trial point in constraint#2 to identif its feasible region pon the graph.
 			2T + 1C  <=100
			0+0 <=100
       			0<=100(constraint is satisfied)
    since point below line(i.e origin) is satisfying the costraint's inequality hence
	feasible region for cons#2 is downward. (we will give an arrow downward from the equation's line)



1/29/2021
=================================================
continueing previous solution
      PLOTTING OBJECTIVE FUNCTION ON GRAPH
     Max Z= $70T + $50C
Note: There are three unknowns i.e Z, T & C in-order to compute points P1 & P2:
	=> Assume profit value or Z= $2,100   
Note: (i) (Any value can be assumed for which points will contain integer values like here p1(30,0) p2(0,42) )
		and donot answer in decimal points as it increases inaccuracy.
      (ii) If for our assumed value the line formed by join of p1 & p2	is outward of feasible region then we 
		will move this line in inward direction(keeping slope constant) the very first point feasible region 
		touched by this moving line will be optimal point. 
	=> The Objective function willbe 	2100=  70T + 50C
	for P1 put C=0
	2100 = 70T + 0
	(T,C)= (30,0).........(i)

	for P2 put T=0
	2100 = 0 + 50C
	(T,C)= (0,42).........(ii)

The last point the line touches before leaving feasible solution will be the optimal point.
 so the C(30,40) is optimal solution.
now we will put it in Objective function equation:
		Z = 70T + 50C
		Z=  70(30)+ 50(40)
		Z=  2100+2000= 4100
		Z= 4100 is the optimal value
===========================================================
	Solution:
		P(30,40) [Optimal Solution point]
		Z= $4100 [Optimal Value]
(we will place this solution in rectangle like this)
============================================================
Alternative method for finding co-ordinatal-points of optimal point.

As from C(30,40) two lines are being passed through i.e cons#1 equation & cons2'equation
	cons#1 Carpentary Constraint eq:   		4T + 3C = 240
	cons#2 Painting and varnishing Constraint eq:   2T + 1C = 100
	
This method is used when the optimal solution is in b/w Graph that is , point doesNot lie on axis points.
solving simultaneously these eqs we get C(30,40) that is our optimal point;


===================================================================================
Another Method to find Optimal solution:
	Corner point Method:
		Acc/ to theory of graphical approach, optimal solution point willbe any of the 
	extreme/corner points i.e in our case any of the (A,B,C,D) so we will put eahc corner point
	in Objective Function and will compare each obtained value hence we will get the Optimal solution.
	i.e At A(0,0)   Z=$0
	    At B(0,80)  Z=$4000
	    At C(30,40) Z=$4100
            At D(50,0)  Z=$3500
hence Profit of C(30,40) is maximum of all hence its an optimal point and Z=4100 is optimal solution
================================================================================



Graphical Solution Example2
==========================================
  Maximize Z= 20A + 30C
 subject to:
  A+2C <=120 .....(i)
  A<=60      .....(ii)
  C<=50	     .....(iii)
  A,C >=0    ......(iV)

==================================================
1/02/2021
==================================================
Step-1: Converting constraints in equations:
Constraint#1: 
A+2C <=120
	After converting into equation:
		A+2C = 120
We need two points P1 & P2 to draw the line of this equation:
a.	For P1 putting A=0 we get:
             0+2C = 120
		2C= 120
		C=60
Hence point P1(A,C)= (0,60)
b.	For P2 putting C=0 we get:
             A+2(0) = 120
		A+0= 120
		A=120
Hence point P1(A,C)= (120,0)
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#1 to identify its feasible region on graph:
A+2C <=120
0+0 <=120
0<=120               => since point below line(i.e origin) is      
                               satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               feasible region for cons#1 is downward.
Constraint#2: 
 A<=60         
	After converting into equation:
		         A=60          (For all values of C value of A is constant)
So the Point P1(A,C)= (60,0);
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#2 to identify its feasible region on graph:
A<=60    
0<=60                => since point below line(i.e origin) is      
                               satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               feasible region for cons#2 is downward.
Constraint#3: 
 C<=50         
	After converting into equation:
		         C=50  		(For all values of A value of C is constant)
So the Point P1(A,C)= (0,50);
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#3 to identify its feasible region on graph:
C<=50
0<=50                => since point below line(i.e origin) is      
                               satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               feasible region for cons#3 is downward.
Constraint#4: 
 A,C >=0       
Since we are working only in first quadrant hence this constraint is already satisfied.




Step-2: Finding feasible region of all constraints:
	5 corner points are found including origin : A,B,C,D,E 
		
Step#2: NOw PLot Objective function:
	Maximize Z= 20A + 30C

 Assuming Z=1800 we get
	1800 = 20A + 30C
  For point P1 put C=0: 
	1800 = 20A + 0
	20A= 1800
	A= 90
	(A,C)= (90,0)
 For point P1 put A=0: 
	1800 = 0 + 30C
	30C= 1800
	C= 60
	(A,C)= (0,60)

Plotting points on Graph and joining both to form its line.
Move this Line in outward direction keeping slope constants since point D is last point touched by this objective function 
	line that's why D is the optimal point for given objective function.
	Now to find point D :
	
     As the D point is intersection of line of cons#1 & cons#2:
	cons#1:  	
		A+2C = 120
	cons#2:
		A=60
	solving simultaneously we get= D(60,30) this is the optimal point

Now for finding optimal solution we will put D(60,30) in objective function's line
	
	Maximize Z= 20A + 30C
	Z= 20(60)   + 30(30)
	Z= 1200+900
	Z= 2100

===========================================================
	Solution:
		P(60,30) [Optimal Solution point]
		Z= $2100 [Optimal Value]
(we will place this solution in rectangle like this)

We need two points P1 & P2 to draw the line of this equation:
	a.	For P1 putting E=0 we get:
             10(0)+15F = 150
		15F= 150
		F=10
	Hence point P1(E,F)= (0,10)
	b.	For P2 putting F=0 we get:
             10E+15(0) = 150
		10E= 150
		E=15
	Hence point P2(E,F)= (15,0)
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#1 to identify its feasible region on graph:
		10.E + 15.F <= 150    
		0+0 <=150
		0<=150               => since point below line(i.e origin) is      
                              		 satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                              		 feasible region for cons#1 is downward.
Constraint#2: 
	 20.E + 10.F <= 160         
	After converting into equation:
		  20.E + 10.F = 160
          i) For P1 putting E=0 we get:
             20(0)+10F = 160
		10F= 160
		F=16
	Hence point P1(E,F)= (0,16)
	 ii)	For P2 putting F=0 we get:
             20E+10(0) = 160
		20E= 160
		E=8
	Hence point P2(E,F)= (8,0)
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#2 to identify its feasible region on graph:
		20.E + 10.F <= 160         
		0+0<=160                => since point below line(i.e origin) is      
                               		satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               		feasible region for cons#2 is downward.


Constraint#3: 
 	30.E + 10.F =135         
	After converting into equation:
		 30.E + 10.F =135
	i) For P1 putting E=0 we get:
             30(0)+10F = 135
		10F= 135
		F=13.5
	Hence point P1(E,F)= (0,13.5)
	ii)	For P2 putting F=0 we get:
             30E+10(0) = 135
		30E= 135
		E=13.5
	Hence point P2(E,F)= (4.5,0)
	Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#3 to identify its feasible region on graph:
		30.E + 10.F >= 135         
		0+0>=135                => since point below line(i.e origin) is  not   
                              	 	satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               		feasible region for cons#3 is upwards.


Constraint#4: 
		E-3F <=0
	After converting into equation:
 		E-3F =0
	i) For P1 putting E=0 we get:
                (0)-3F = 0
		-3F= 0
		F=0
	Hence point P1(E,F)= (0,0)
	ii)	For P2 putting F=2(any value other than 0 so that we can plot on graph) we get:
                E-3(2) = 0
		E-6= 0
		E=6
	Hence point P2(E,F)= (6,2)
Now Taking Origin(6,4) as a trial point in Constraint#4 to identify its feasible region on graph:
		E - 3.F <= 0         
		6-12<=0                => since point above line is satisfying               
                                   	 the constraint's inequality hence     
                               		feasible region for cons#4 is upwards.

Constraint#5: 
		E+F>=5
      After converting into equation:
 		E+F =5
	i) For P1 putting E=0 we get:
               (0)+ F = 5
		F= 5
	Hence point P1(E,F)= (0,5)
	ii)	For P2 putting F=0 we get:
                E+(0) = 5
		E= 5
	Hence point P2(E,F)= (5,0)
Now Taking Origin(0,0) as a trial point in Constraint#4 to identify its feasible region on graph:
		E + F >=5         
		0+0>=0                => since point below line(i.e origin) is not            
                            		satisfying the constraint's inequality hence     
                               		feasible region for cons#5 is upwards.


STEP-2:  Plotting objective function:
		Maximize Z= 5000.E + 4000.F

Assuming Z=20000 we get
	20000 = 5000.E + 4000.F  

	i)	 For point P1 put E=0: 
		20000 = 0 + 4000F
		4000F= 20000
		F= 5
		(E,F)= (0,5)

	ii)	For point P2 put F=0: 
		20000 = 5000E + 0
		5000E= 20000
		E= 4
		(E,F)= (4,0)

Plotting points on Graph and joining both to form its line.
Move this Line in outward direction keeping slope constants since point C is last point touched by this objective function 
	line that's why C is the optimal point for given objective function.
	Now to find point C :
	
As the C point is intersection of line of cons#1 & cons#2 lines:
	cons#1:  	
		10.E + 15.F = 150    
	cons#2:
		20.E + 10.F = 160
	solving simultaneously we get= C(4.5,7) this is the optimal point
	 
Now for finding optimal solution we will put C(4.5,7) in objective function's line
	
	Maximize Z= 5000.E + 4000.F
	Z= 5000(4.5)   + 4000(7)
	Z= 22500+28000
	Z= 50500

===========================================================
	Solution:
		P(4.5,7) [Optimal Solution point]
		Z= $50500 [Optimal Value]

Irregular Lp-Models/ Special Cases of Lp-Models:
=====================================================================
	1) LP-Model having Multiple Optimal Solution Points:
		If Objective Function line is parallel to a boundary constraint then there's possibility that 
		there willbe multiple optimal Solutions Point.
	2) Infeasible Lp-Model	:  a Linear Program having too many constraints that are not  satisfied simultaneously.
					& is also called over-constrated LP_Model.
	3) Unbouded LP-model: A problem in which Feasible region is not closed/ profit value without having any limit.

Examples:
	e.g 1: Infeasible problem:
================================================================
		Max z= 2x1 + 6x2
	   subject to:
		4x1 + 3x2 <=12
		2x1 + x2>=8
		x1,x2>=0		

	P1 for cons#1 Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,4)
	P2 for cons#1 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (3,0)	

	P1 for cons#2 Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,8)
	P2 for cons#2 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (4,0)	

=> Plot these points on Graph:
	Feasible region for Cons#1= downwards
	Feasible region for Cons#2= upwards
=> As we see that there's no any common feasible region for all constraints that satisfy all constraints so we can 
	conclude that Its an Infeasible Problem hence we will not solve it further.


	E.g 2: Unbounded Problem:
=============================================================
		The feasible region is unbounded and the objective function line can be moved parallel to itself without
		bound so that z can be increased infinitely.
	Max   z= 3x1+4x2
	s.t
          x1+x2>=5
	  3x1 + x2 >=8
      	   x1,x2>=0

	P1 for cons#1 Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,5)
	P2 for cons#1 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (5,0)	

	P1 for cons#2 Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,8)
	P2 for cons#2 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (2.67,0)	


Plot these points on Graph:
	Feasible region for Cons#1= upwards
	Feasible region for Cons#2= upwards
=> As we see that there's common feasible region is upwards  for all constraints .

Now PLotting Objective Function's Line:
	Assuming Z=12;
	12 = 3x1+4x2
	
	P1 for OF Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,3)
	P2 for OF Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (4,0)	

Plot these points on Graph and join them: 
	Move this O.F line  outwards:

	since we see its closed in internal boundary but not in external boundary that increases profit value Respectively
	so we can say that problem is unbounded problem.
  

	e.g 3: Multiple Optimal Solution Points problem:
================================================================
		Max z= 3x1 - x2
	   subject to:
		15x1 - 5x2 <=30
		10x1 + 30x2<=120
		x1,x2>=0		

	P1 for cons#1 Put x1=3(other values result in -ve result):
		(x1,x2)= (3,3)
	P2 for cons#1 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (2,0)	

	P1 for cons#2 Put x1=0:
		(x1,x2)= (0,4)
	P2 for cons#2 Put x2=0:
		(x1,x2)= (12,0)	

=> Plot these points on Graph:
	Feasible region for Cons#1= downwards   i.e found by substituting Origin(0,0)
	Feasible region for Cons#2= downwards   i.e found by substituting Origin(0,0)

STEP-2:  Plotting objective function:
		Max z= 3x1 - x2

Assuming Z=3 we get
	3 = 3.x1 - x2  

	i)	 For point P1 put x1=2: 
		3 = 3(2) - x2
		-3=-x2
		x2= 3
		(x1,x2)= (2,3)

	ii)	For point P2 put x2=0: 
		3 = 3x1 - 0
		3=3x1
		x1= 1
		(x1,x2)= (1,0)

Join these Points to form O.F's Line
Since we see that moving this Line in outward direction, the line overlaps the equation line of Cons#1
Hence we can say all points lying on cons#1 line will be the optimal solution points let's prove it:
	As Point B(3,3) & C(2,0) also lie on this line so we will put both for finding optimal value:
		  Max z= 3x1 - x2
		putting point B(3,3) we get:
		  z= 3(3)-3
		  z= 9-3
		  z=6

		 Max z= 3x1 - x2
		putting point C(2,0) we get:
		  z= 3(2)-0
		  z= 6-0
		  z=6
	Let's take Another point X(2.6,1.8) lying on this line for checking too:
		 Max z= 3x1 - x2
		putting point X(2.6,1.8) we get:
		  z= 3(2.6)-1.8
		  z= 7.8-1.8
		  z=6

Since the Value of O.F we get For each at these points is 6 hence 
	6 is the optimal value But O.F has many Optimal Points.

Slack (variable/value):

Active & Inactive Constraints:
=====================================
 Active constraint: Which actively participate in optimal solution points.
 inActive constraint: which participate in formulating Feasible region only. 

IN Our example of E9 & F9 Const#1 (Dept-A) and Cons#2 (Dept-B) are passing through optimal solution point i.e C(4.5,7)
	Hence they are Active Constraints.

IN Our example of E9 & F9 Const#3, Cons#2 & Cons#3 are not passing through optimal solution point i.e C(4.5,7)
	Hence they are Inactive Constraints.

=>A Constraint when evaluated on OPtimal solution point(s) gives L.H.S=R.H.S is called active constraint.
e.g:  Constraint#1 (Dept-A)
	150=150    //L.H.S=R.H.S
      Constraint#2 (Dept-B):
	160=160    //L.H.S=R.H.S
	
=>A constraint when evaluated on optimal solution point(s) gives L.H.S!=R.H.S is called inactive constraint.
e.g   Cons#3 ( Testing)
	205 != 135   //L.H.S != R.H.S
	
      Cons-4 (Ratio) 
	-16.5 !=0    //L.H.S != R.H.S

    & Cons#5(Combination)
	11.5 !=5     //L.H.S != R.H.S


Geometrical Interpretation Of Constraints:
	1. If a Constraint's equation line is passing through Optimal solution point then constraint is 
	    called Active constraint.  

	2 If a Constraint's equation line is not passing through Optimal solution point then constraint is 
	    called Inactive constraint.

=>No need to solve simultaneouly the constraints's equation as A point lie on x2 Axis line:

Now to find optimal value put A(0,8) in Objective function:

=> We could also Used Corner point method to find optimal solution point here.
=>As its an minimization model so the corner point resulting in least value willbe the optimal point.

	=>When LP models were formulated in, it was implicitly assumed that parameters(coefficients in equations)
		of model were known exactly/ with certainity. But we should be noted they are not always 100% certain 
			they are always subject to change.
	=>For this reason, it's interest to manager to identify what change in solution of model occurs by a change in a

	ii)	For point P2 put x2=0: 
		4x1  + 3(0) <=120 
		4.x1= 120
		x1=30
		(x1,x2)= (30,0)

	Feasible region = downwards

PLotting objective function:
	maximize Z= $40x1 + $50x2
	
assume z=800	
	800= 40x1+ 50x2
	i)	For point P1 put x1=0: 
		800= 40(0)+ 50x2
		50x2= 800
		x2=16
		(x1,x2)= (0,16)

	ii)	For point P2 put x2=0: 
		800= 40x1 + 50(0)
		40x1= 800
		x1=20
		(x1,x2)= (20,0)
After PLotting on graph move this line in outward direction
since point B is last point touched by this line before leaving feasible region so to find B 

	As B is intersection of cons#1 & cons#2 lines so solving simultaneoulsy we get
			 x1  + 2x2 <=40		
		        4x1  + 3x2 <=120
Hence B is B(24,8)
To find optimal value put B(24,8) in O.F :
	z= 40x1+ 50x2
	z= 40(24) + 50(8)
	z=1360




======================================================
1)Now changing Coefficients(x1) Of Objective function:
i.e 
	NEW MODEL:
	======================================================
	new maximize Z= $100x1 + 50x2
		subject to
 			 x1  + 2x2 <=40		hr. of labor
		        4x1  + 3x2 <=120		120 lb. of clay
			    x1,x2>=0

Assuming z= 3000;
	3000= 100x1+ 50x2
	i)	For point P1 put x1=0: 
		3000= 100(0)+ 50x2
		50x2= 3000
		x2=60
		(x1,x2)= (0,60)

	ii)	For point P2 put x2=0: 
		3000= 100x1 + 50(0)
		100x1= 3000
		x1=30
		(x1,x2)= (30,0)

After PLotting on graph move this line in  inward
since point C is first point touched by this line before entering into feasible region.

	As C lies on x1 axis;
Hence C is B(30,0)
To find optimal value put C(30,0) in O.F :
	Z= $100x1 + 50x2
	z= 100(30) + 50(0)
	z=  3000


So Now calculating difference b/w Old & New Z;
	delta OV(delta Z)= Z(new) -Z(old)
	delta objective value z= 3000-1360
	delta OV z= 1640
==========================================================================================
So The objective Function's Optimal value changes by 1640 by changing coefficient of x1;
==========================================================================================




MM/DD/YYYY
2/12/2021
=========================================================================================
	Conclusion:
	1. There was no change in feasible region.
	2. Optimal solution point was changes from B(24,8) to point C(30,0)
	3. Optimal value was also changed and new optimal value		
		 i.e new Z =3000
	4. Delta OV=1640(new Z - old Z)
	
2)Now changing Coefficients(x2) Of Objective function:
i.e 
	NEW MODEL:
	======================================================
	new maximize Z1= $40x1 + 100x2
		subject to
 			 x1  + 2x2 <=40		hr. of labor
		        4x1  + 3x2 <=120		120 lb. of clay
			    x1,x2>=0


	Assuming z= 3000;
	3000= 40x1+ 50x2
	i)	For point P1 put x1=0: 
		3000= 40(0)+ 100x2
		100x2= 3000
		x2=60
		(x1,x2)= (0,30)

	ii)	For point P2 put x2=0: 
		3000= 40x1 + 1000(0)
		40x1= 3000
		x1=30
		(x1,x2)= (30,0)

After PLotting on graph move this line in inward
since point A is first point touched by this line before entering into feasible region.

	As A lies on x2 axis;
Hence C is C(0,20)
To find optimal value put C(0,20) in O.F :
	Z= $40x1 + 100x2
	z= 40(0) + 100(20)
	z=  2000


So Now calculating difference b/w Old & New Z;
	delta OV(delta Z)= Z(new) -Z(old)
	delta objective value z= 2000-1360
	delta OV z= 640
==========================================================================================
So The objective Function's Optimal value changes by 640 by changing coefficient of x2;
==========================================================================================




==================================================================
	max Z= 40x1 + 50x2
	subject to
 		 x1  + 2x2 <=40		hr. of labor
	        4x1  + 3x2 <=120	120 lb. of clay
		    x1,x2>=0
	
Now we have to Find Range of values for this Objective Function's coefficients Over which the Optimal solution point will
	remain Optimal.

let C1=40
let C2=50


==============================================================================================
Sensitivity Range for C1:
==============================================================================================
		
	Range of Values(Maximum value,Minimum value) over which current optimal solution point will remain optimal.
Note=>For finding Maximum & Minimum Value oF C1,C2 we will need to equate slope of Objective Function to slope of 
	each Active Constraint.
	
		Z= 40x1 + 50x2
		50x2= Z - 40x1
		x2 = Z/50 - 40x1/50
Equation in the form of : y= mx+c; or y= a+bx
i.e we need to find slope:
	so intercept a= Z/50
	   intercept b= -4/5
=====================================================
So Slope of max z= -a/b= -40/50 = -C1/C2
=====================================================
For slope We will take Active constraints:

cons#2:	4x1  + 3x2 <=120		
	slope= -4/3
so now:
    -C1/C2= -4/3
    or
    -C1/50=-4/3			:>C2=50
       -3C1= 50 * -4
	-3C1= -200
	C1=66.67(maximum value)


Cons#1:   x1  + 2x2 <=40	
	slope= -a/b= -1/2
so now:
 	-c1/c2= -1/2
	-c1/50= -1/2		:>C2=50
	-2c1= -50
	c1=25(minimum value)

So Sensitivity range for C1= 25<=C1<=66.67 (Sensitivity Range Of C1)
	i.e By changing C1 in this range point B(24,8) will still be the optimal solution point however optimal 
		value of O.F fun may change.



==============================================================================================
Sensitivity Range for C2:
==============================================================================================
	For slope We will take Active constraints:
	
cons#2:	4x1  + 3x2 <=120		
	slope= -4/3
so now:
    -C1/C2= -4/3
    or
    -40/C2=-4/3			:>C1=40
       c2= 120/4
	C2=30(minimum value)


Cons#1:   x1  + 2x2 <=40	
	slope= -a/b= -1/2
so now:
 	-c1/c2= -1/2
	-40/c2= -1/2     	:>C1=40
	c2= 80
	c1=80(maximum value)

So Sensitivity range for C2= 30<=C2<=80 (Snsitivity Range Of C2)
	i.e By changing C2 in this range point B(24,8) will still be the optimal solution point however optimal 
		value of O.F fun may change.


NOTE:
	1.Change in Objective function co-efficients does not change feasible region of Lp-Model.
	2.Optimal solution point may or may not be change acc/ to range.
	3.OPtimal value will change because of changes in parameters/co-efficients.
	4. delta OV= Znew- Zold

=========================================================================================

B) Changes in constraints's coefficients(x1):
================================================
	max Z= 40x1 + 50x2
	subject to
 		 x1  + 2x2 <=40		hr. of labor
	        4x1  + 3x2 <=120	120 lb. of clay
		    x1,x2>=0
:>Old Z= 1360
	i)(a)Changing Cons#1 coefficient(i.e An active constraint):
		x1 + 2x2<=60
	in equation:
		x1 + 2x2 =60
	so p1 & p2 are P1(60,0) & P2(0,30)
Plot these points on graph.

For feasible region put  O(0,0) as trial point:
	 x1 + 2x2 <=60
	 0 + 0 <=60
	hence Feasible region=downwards;

Since point B' is last point  touched by O.F line while moving outwards.
	And Its an intersection point of con#1(new) & cons#2's equation line so
	solving them silmutaneously we get:
		x1   + 2x2 =60		
	        4x1  + 3x2 =120
	B'(24,18)
To find optimal value put B'(24,18) in O.F:
	Z= $40x1 +  50x2
	z= 40(24) + 50(18)
	z=  1860


So Now calculating difference b/w Old & New Z;
	delta OV(delta Z)= Z(new) -Z(old)
	delta objective value z= 1860-1360
	delta OV z= 500
=========================================================================================================
So The objective Function's Optimal value changes by 500 by changing right side of cons#1 from 40 to 60;
=========================================================================================================
	


Conslusion:
 1. There is a parallel shift in the constraint's line:
 2. Feasible region has been enlarged/shrink by changing right side of 1st constraint.
 3. Optimal value may or may not change depending on constraint(i.e is active/inactive).
 4. Optimal solution may change if we changed resources(i.e right side) of a non-binding(inactive) constraint.
 5. Changing in the right side of binding constraint's always change the solution.


	
	i)(b)Changing Cons#1 coefficient:
		x1 + 2x2<=80
	in euqation:
		x1 + 2x2 =80
	so p1 & p2 are P1(80,0) & P2(0,40)

Plot these points on graph.

For feasible region put  O(0,0) as trial point:
	 x1 + 2x2 <=80
	 0 + 0 <=80
	hence Feasible region=downwards;

Since point A'' is last point  touched by O.F line while moving outwards.
	As A'' point lies on x2 axis Hence no need to solve silmutaneously the equations:
	So the A'' point is A''(0,40)


To find optimal value put A''(0,40) in O.F:
	Z= $40x1 +  50x2
	z= 40(0) + 50(40)
	z=  2000


So Now calculating difference b/w Old & New Z;
	delta OV(delta Z)= Z(new) -Z(old)
	delta objective value z= 2000-1360
	delta OV z= 640
========================================================================================================
So The objective Function's Optimal value changes by 640 by changing right side of cons#1 from 40 t0 80;
========================================================================================================


Conclusion:
 1. There is a parallel shift in the constraint#1's line:
 2. Feasible region has been enlarged by changing right side of constraint#1 from 40 to 80.
 3. Optimal value has been changed by 640 units from original value.
 4. Optimal Solution Point has been changed from B(24,8) to A''(0,40).

THE DUAL LINEAR PROGRAM:
========================
	=>For every LP(linear program)i.e primal problem, there is always a corresponding lp problem called as 'dual' problem or dual lp.
	=>Primal LP is converted into Dual Lp by some set of transformation rules.
		Primal LP -----> Transformation Rules ------> Dual LP
	=>We convert Primal lp to dual lp because dual has economic, theoritic & computational significiance over primal lp.


	Example of Primal LP:
	E-9s and F-9s problem & etc.

Example to convert A primal problem into dual problem:
======================================================
 	Maximize Z= 3x1 + 4x2 - 2x3
	subject to:
		 4x1 -12x2 +3x3<= 12    ......(i)  
		-2x1 + 3x2 +x3 <= 6	......(ii) 
		-5x1 +x2-6x3 >= -40	......(iii)  
		3x1+4x2-2x3 =10		......(iv)  
		x1>=0, x2<=0, x3 is unconstrained in sign.


Rule#1: The no of variables in the dual problem is equal to number of constraints in the original(primal) problem. The number of constraints in the
	 dual problem(dp) is equal to no of variables in primal problem(pp).
	Result of Rule#1: 4 variables(y1,y2,y3,y4)   //as there were 4 constraints in pp
			  3 constraints		//as there were 3 variables in pp
		
Rule#2: Co-efficient of the objective function in DP come from right hand side of constraints of primal problem:
		
		Result of rule#2: Objective function of dual problem:
			Z = 12y1 + 6y2 - 40y3 + 10y4			//12y1 //12 came from right side of first constraint
				//still we are unaware of Z is either max or min objective function.

Rule#3: If primal problem is maximization problem then dual problem willbe a minimization problem and vice versa.
		Result of rule#3:  Dual will be minimiaztion problem 		//as pp is a maximization problem. 
			MIN Z = 12y1 + 6y2 - 40y3 + 10y4

Rule#4: The co-efficiens of the first constraint function for the dual problem are the co-efficients of first variable in the constraints for the pp
		& similarly for other constraints.
    Result of rule#4:  left hand side of constraints
	cons#1:	4y1 - 2y2 -5y3 + 3y4
	cons#2: -12y1 + 3y2 +y3 + 4y4
	cons#3: 3y1 + y2 -6y3 - 2y4


Rule#5: The right hand side of dual constraints come from the objective function coefficients in the original problem.
    Result of Rule#5:  Right hand side of constrainst:
	cons#1: 3
	cons#2: 4
	cons#3: -2

//continueing previous primal problem:

Rule#6: The sign of the ith dual constraint is '=' if and only if the ith variable in the original problem is unconstrained in sign:

		so third constraint becomes	:

		cons#3:  3y1 + y2 -6y3 - 2y4 = -2			:>as x3 was 'x3 is unconstrained'


Rule#7: If the original problem is a Max(or Min) model,then after applying Rule#6, assign to remaining dual constraints a sign of

		cons#2:	-12y1 + 3y2 +y3 + 4y2 <=4			:>as x2 was x2<=0

Rule#8: The ith variable in the dual problem is unconstrained in sign if and only if the ith constraint in the original problem 
		is an equality constraint:
	Result of Rule#8:
		Y4 is unconstrained in sign;

Rule#9: If Original PP ia a Max(Min) model then after applying Rule#8, assign to the remaining dual variables a sign of opposite

Relations b/w Primal & Dual LP:
===============================

Property#1: 
	=>The dual of the dual problem is again the primal problem.
	Primal Lp -------> Dual Lp--------->Dual Lp(Dual LP)-------->Primal LP
    PROOF:
    =====
	1.Let's take same LP Model that we first converted into Dual:
	   a)	Maximize Z= 3x1 + 4x2 - 2x3
	subject to:
	        cons#1: 4x1 -12x2 +3x3<= 12    ......(i)

		x1>=0, x2<=0, x3 is unconstrained in sign.

 	  Equivalent DUAL LP Model:
  	  ==============================
	    b)	MIN Z = 12y1 + 6y2 - 40y3 + 10y4
	subject to:
		cons#1:	 4y1 - 2y2 -5y3 + 3y4 >= 3	  -------(i)		
		cons#2:	-12y1 + 3y2 +y3 + 4y4 <=4	  -------(ii)		
		cons#3:  3y1 + y2 -6y3 - 2y4 = -2	  -------(iii)	
			y1>=0 , y2>=0 , y3<=0 , y4 is unconstrained.

	=>Let's Consider this Dual Problem (b) as Primal Lp and Try to convert it into Dual-LP using same set of Transformation rules:
		
	DUAL OF THE DUAL LP:
	====================
Result of Rule#1: 3 variables(x1,x2,x3)   //as there were 3 constraints in pp
		  4 constraints		//as there were 4 variables in pp
		
Result of rule#2: Objective function of dual problem:
		Z = 3x1 + 4x2 -2x3		
 			//still we are unaware of Z is either max or min objective function.

Result of rule#3:  Dual will be maximiaztion problem 		//as pp is a minimization problem. 
		Max Z = 3x1 + 4x2 -2x3

Result of Rule#4:  left hand side of constraints
	cons#1:	 4x1 - 12x2 + 3x3
	cons#2: -2x1 + 3x2  +  x3 
	cons#3: -5x1 +  x2  -  6x3 
	cons#4:  3x1 + 4x2  -  2x3

Result of Rule#5:  Right hand side of constraints:
	cons#1: 12
	cons#2: 6
	cons#3: -40
	cons#4: 10
		Still we don't know about sign of left hand side & right hand side.

      L.H.S     			R.H.S
cons#1:  4x1 - 12x2 + 3x3		  12
cons#2: -2x1 + 3x2  +  x3 		   6 
cons#3: -5x1 +  x2  - 6x3 		 -40
cons#4:  3x1 + 4x2  - 2x3		  10

Result of Rule#6:
	cons#4:  3x1 + 4x2 - 2x3 = 10		:>as y4 was 'y4 is unconstrained'

Result of Rule#7:  
		For Minimization dual constraint's sign= opposite to corresponding variable's sign in as of PP
	cons#1:	 4x1 - 12x2 + 3x3 <= 12			:>as y1 was y1>=0
	cons#2:	-2x1 + 3x2  +  x3 <=6			:>as y2 was y2>=0
	cons#3:	-5x1 +  x2 -  6x3 >=-40			:>as y3 was y3<=0

Result of Rule#8:
	x3 is unconstrained in sign;    //as 3rd constraint has equality sign

Result of Rule#9:
	    For Minimization dual variable sign= same as corresponding constraint's sign in pp
	x1>=0;		//as 1st constraint  is of '>=' inequality
	x2<=0;		//as 2nd constraint  is of '<=' inequality
	
so Dual Model Of Dual Problem:
	Maximize Z= 3x1 + 4x2 - 2x3
	subject to:
		 4x1 -12x2 +3x3<= 12    ......(i)  
		-2x1 + 3x2 +x3 <= 6	......(ii) 
		-5x1 +x2-6x3 >= -40	......(iii)  
		3x1+4x2-2x3 =10		......(iv)  
		x1>=0, x2<=0, x3 is unconstrained in sign.

	As we see Primal Lp -------> Dual Lp--------->Dual Lp(Dual LP)-------->Primal LP
		Hence Property#1 Proved.

Property#2:
	=>Either of two problems has an optimal solution if and only if the other does.
		When there is a solution the optimal value of O.F in the primal is same as the optimal value of the O.F of the dual.

	For Multiple Optimal Solution Points(multiple optimal points):
		Z(primal) = Z(dual)
	=>i.e Max Z(primal) = Min Z(dual);

Property#3:
	If One problem is feasible but unbounded, then the other is infeasible; if one is infeasible then other is either infeasible or
		feasible/unbounded.

Property#4:
	=>If(x1,x2,x3...Xn) is any set of Primal Feasible Values and  If(y1,y2,y3...Yn) is any set of dual Feasible Values, the primal O.F(i.e
		the function to be maximized) evaluated at x can not exceed the dual O.F(i.e the function to be minimized) evaluated at y.
	PROOF:
	======
	Consider This as Primal LP model:
		Max Z= 3x1 + 4x2
	subject to: 
	       -2x1+3x2 <=6
	        5x1 - x2 <=40
	        x1+ x2 <=7

THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS:
============================
  =>There are 4 algorithms to solve a transportation problem.
  =>First two algos are used to find initial feasible solution & rest are used to find final optimal solution.

   1. NWCM(north west corner method)
   2. Vogel's approximation method.
   3. Stepping stone method.
   4. Modified distribution method.

1. NWCM(north west corner method):
=================================
	It is used to find initial feasible solution of a transportation problem and contains 4 steps.
	
   Step-1: Start in the upper left corner(north west corner) and allocate as many units as possible.
   Step-2: Adjust supply & demand values accordingly.
   Step-3: If supply=0 then eliminate that row for further consideration, if demand=0 then eliminate that column
		from further consideration.
   Step-4: Move from left to right and allocate maximum possible units, stop when supply & demand is equal to zero.
	

2. Vogel's approximation method:
================================
	It is used to find initial feasible solution of a transportation problem and contains 6 steps.

   Step-1: For each row & each column calculate the penality cost by subtracting smallest entry from 2nd smallest entry.
   Step-2: Identify the row or column with largest penality cost value.
   Step-3: Allocate maximum possible units to the available route or cell with the lowest cost(per unit) in the row or column
		selected in step-2(i.e having largest penality cost value(pcv)).
   Step-4: Adjust the supply & demand values according to allocation.
   Step-5: Remove any row with zero supply, & any column with zero demand, from further consideration.
   Step-6: Return to step-1.(repeat process until supply & demand both become zero for all sources,destinations repectively.)
		
			Penality Cost = 2nd smallest entry - smallest entry(in terms of cost pr unit).
	=>This method introduces better initial feasible solution than NWCM because of considering cost values.


3. Stepping stone method(SSM):
=========================
	It is used to find final optimal solution to a transportation problem.
   =>This method is used to convert initial feasible solution to optimal solution hence it can not be applied on 
	a blank transportation table. For this method to work it requires a filled transportation table with the
	solution given by (NWCM or Vogels's approximation method).
   =>We will need to find marginal cost values(for unused cells).
   =>the insertion of (+)  & (-) (i.e that indicate addition & subtraction of 1 unit through particular route or cell respectively)
	makes a path that is known as stepping stone path.
	e.g
	 suppose A4 is a unused column & stepping stone path has values(i.e cost per of each cell that is included in this path) 
		like: +6,-4,+9,-13
		so the marginal cost for A4 cell will be:
	M.C value for A4=  +6-4+9-13=-2 
		=>That means if we incorporate this route(A4) then per unit whole cost will decreased by 2$.

4. Modified Distribution method(MDM):
================================
	It is also used to find final optimal solution to a transportation problem.
   =>It is a two step procedure for finding marginal costs as is some how same as 'STEPPING STONE METHOD' but the way
	we compute marginal cost values is different.
   =>It is preferred over 'STEPPING STONE METHOD(SSM)' when we have a large number of source/destination points because in 
	it is cumborsome to make stepping stone path again and again of so many source/destination points for computing
	marginal cost values.
   =>Usually we use SSM method when we have (source/destination points <= 4) but after that we prefer to use MDM method.

	It consists of 2-main steps:
	======================
   Step-1: Determine an index for each row & each column such that:
		     Ui + Vj = Cij .................(i)	        :- For every used cell
	//where Ui is the index of ith row & Vj is index of jth column & Cij is the cost per unit of (i,j)th cell/route.
	//Or Cij is the cost of sending a unit through origin(source) 'i' to destination 'j'

   Step-2: Calculate marginal cost for every unused cell by using equation:
		eij = Cij - (Ui+Vj) ................(ii)	:- For every used cell
	//where eij is marginal cost value of (i,j)th cell.
	//Cij is the cost per unit of (i,j) cell.
	//Ui & Vj are the indices of ith row & jth column respectively.
    =>Rest of the steps are same as in the SSM method.

    =>This method is used to convert initial feasible solution to optimal solution hence it can not be applied on 
	a blank transportation table. For this method to work it requires a filled transportation table with the
	solution given by (NWCM or Vogels's approximation method).
  
	so we will use our previous transportation table(i.e with output of NWCM):
	
		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	   4	supply

			A		400(12)	100(13)	  (4)	  (6)      500
			B		  (6)	700(4)	  (10)	  (11)     700	
			C		 (10)	100(9)	200(12)	 500(4)    800

		      Demand		  400	  900	  200	  500   2000\2000
Step-1: Finding row & column indices.
		Ui + Vj = Cij        
    =>For every used cell we will now make this kind of equation but first of all we need to know about Ui & Vj
		that is below:
	Row(sources)-indices:
	============
		here Ui=U(A,B,C)   =>Ua,Ub,Uc		//let A=a , B=b, C=c for readability

	Column(destinations)-indices:
	==============
		here Vj=V(1,2,3,4) =>V1,V2,V3,V4
	
   =>Now making equations:
	Used Cells(A1,A2,B2,C2,C3,C4)
    values for Cij(12,13, 4, 9,12, 4)		//cost per unit for each corresponding cell 
	so we need to form equation of each of these cells(i.e total 6 equations):
	
	1. A1 => Ua  + V1 =  Ca1  => Ua  + V1 = 12 -------(i)
	2. A2 => Ua  + V2 =  Ca2  => Ua  + V2 = 13 -------(ii)
	3. B2 => Ub  + V2 =  Ca2  => Ub  + V2 =  4 -------(iii)
	4. C2 => Uc  + V2 =  Ca2  => Uc  + V2 =  9 -------(iv)
	5. C3 => Uc  + V3 =  Ca3  => Uc  + V3 = 12 -------(v)
	6. C4 => Uc  + V4 =  Ca4  => Uc  + V4 =  4 -------(vi)

Total Unknowns/Variables(7): Ua,V1,V2,Ub,Uc,V3,V4
   =>We have to find these unknowns/variables using these 6 equations but we can't find that by solving simultaneously the 
	equations so we will assume value for one of these varaibles to find values of 6 others.

	let Ua=0
	  =>Now we will find other variables' values by putting required values in corresponding equations:
	From eq-(i):
		Ua  + V1 = 12
		0   + V1 = 12		:- Ua=0
		      V1 = 12

	From eq-(ii):
		Ua  + V2 = 13
		0   + V2 = 13		:- Ua=0
		      V2 = 13

	From eq-(iii):
		Ub  + V2 =  4
		Ub  + 13 =  4		:- V2=13
		Ub  = 4 - 13
		Ub  = -9

	From eq-(iv):
		Uc  + V2 = 9
		Uc  + 13 = 9		:- V2=13
		Uc  = 9 - 13
		Uc  = -4

	From eq-(v):
		Uc  + V3 = 12
		-4  + V3 = 12		:- Uc=-4
		V3  = 12 + 4
		V3  = 16


	From eq-(vi):
		Uc  + V4 = 4
		-4  + V4 = 4		:- Uc=-4
		V4  =  4 + 4
		V4  =  8

	so we got values for all unknowns as:
	Ua =  0
	V1 = 12
	V2 = 13
	Ub = -9
	Uc = -4
	V3 = 16
	V4 =  8

==========
	Step-2: Calculating marignal cost(or opportunity cost) values for unused cell:
	 	Eij= Cij-(Ui+Vj)        :-For every unused cells
	Un-used Cells(A3,A4,B1,B3,B4,C1)
       values for Cij( 4, 6, 6,10,11,10)		//cost per unit for each corresponding cell 
	so we need to form equation of each of these cells(i.e total 6 equations):
	1. A3 => Ca3 - (Ua  + V3) =  Ea3 => 4 - (0 + 16) = -12 -------(i)
	2. A4 => Ca4 - (Ua  + V4) =  Ea4 => 6 - (0 +  8) =  -2 -------(ii)
	3. B1 => Cb1 - (Ub  + V1) =  Eb1 => 6 - (-9 + 12)=   3 -------(iii)
	4. B3 => Cb3 - (Ub  + V3) =  Eb3 =>10 - (-9 + 16)=   3 -------(iv)
	5. B4 => Cb4 - (Ub  + V4) =  Eb4 =>11 - (-9 + 8) =  12 -------(v)
	6. C1 => Cc1 - (Uc  + V1) =  Ec1 =>10 - (-4 + 12)=   2 -------(vi)

  So the marginal cost values for unused cells are as under:
       unused cell 	marinal values
	A3 =   		-12
	A4 =		 -2
	B1 = 		  3
	B3 =		  3
	B4 =		 12
	C1 = 		  2
Remaining steps:-
===============
	//are same as SSM method steps.	
   =>As we see in this iteration, A3 cell has maximum negative(-12) marginal cost value that is if we incorporate this cell
		then per unit we will save 12$ of our cost, so we will incorporate this cell.
	so we will find stepping stone path of A3 now:

==========
		after making stepping stone path new table becomes:
		
		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	   4	supply

			A		400(12)	  0(13)	 100(4)	  (6)      500
			B		  (6)	700(4)	  (10)	  (11)     700	
			C		 (10)	200(9)	100(12)	 500(4)    800

		      Demand		  400	  900	  200	  500   2000\2000

		//A2,C2,C3 are modified because of allocation in A3(unused cell having highest marginal cost value)
		//so now the cell A3 is used cell and A2 is a un-used cell hence our first iteration is complete now.
		

Rule for Marginal Cost:
=======================
	=>Check O.C(opportunity costs) >=0
	=>If all values are o.c>0 but one o.c=0 then solution is optimal but not unique.



Handling Unbalanced Transportation Model:
========================================
		A transportation model where demand & supply are not equal.
	Two cases:
	1. When supply exceed demand:
	=============================
	e.g:
	===
		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	      supply

			A		 (12)	  (13)	  (4)	        200
			B		  (6)	  (4)	  (10)	        100	
			C		 (10)	  (9)	  (12)	        400

		      Demand		  200	  100	  300	     600\700

		Solution to this is , that we will add a dummy destination point like:

		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	  4    supply

			A		 (12)	  (13)	  (4)	 (0)     200
			B		  (6)	  (4)	  (10)	 (0)     100	
			C		 (10)	  (9)	  (12)	 (0)     400

		      Demand		  200	  100	  300	 100    700\700

 	2. When demand exceed supply:
	=============================
	e.g:
		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	  4    supply

			A		 (12)	  (13)	  (4)	 (0)     200
			B		  (6)	  (4)	  (10)	 (0)     300	
			C		 (10)	  (9)	  (12)	 (0)     300

		      Demand		 100	  200	  450	 250    1000\800
	
		Solution to this is , that we will add a dummy source point like:
		
		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	  4    supply

			A		 (12)	  (13)	  (4)	 (0)     200
			B		  (6)	  (4)	  (10)	 (0)     300	
			C		 (10)	  (9)	  (12)	 (0)     300
			D		  (0)     (0)      (0)   (0)     200
		      Demand		 100	  200	  450	 250    1000\1000
	


Solving Maximization Transportation Problems:
============================================
	=>same steps as of previous transportation problems(i.e minimization problems).
		only change is that we will allocate in that cell where marginal cost(M.C) value is highest(+ve) than all
		and will repeat iterations till all M.Cs become zero or negative(-ve).


Degeneracy in Transportation problems:
=====================================
	=>In a standrad transporataion problem with m sources of supply and n demand destination, the test of optimality 
		of any feasible solution requires allocations in 
			m+n-1	
	=>independent cells. If the no of allocations is less than it, then solution is said to be degenerate solution.	
		OR
	If the number of used cells is less than (m+n-1) then it is called as degeneracy in transportation problem.

   Example:(Transportation-table(T.T) filled with NWCM solution):

		source\Destination	   1	   2	   3	  4    supply  it(#1)

			A		 400(12)  100(13) (4)	 (6)     500    100 
			B		  (6)	  700(4)  A.U.C(10)	 (11)    700			//AUT=Artificial used cell
			C		 (10)	  (9)	 200(12) 600(4)  800

		      Demand		 400	  800	  200	 600    2000\2000
		
		so here no of used cells= 5(A1,A2,B2,C3,C4)
		According to definition of degeneracy:
			=>if no of used-cells(let n.u.s) < m+n-1 then transportation problem is degenerated.
		As we see in our Example problem m(no of source points)= 3			
					       & n(no of desti. points)= 4
		so the m+n-1= 3+4-1=6 
		but in our example problem we have 5 used cells that is less than 6, hence we can say that it is a degenerated 
			solution to this transportation problem.

==========
	Let's apply modified distribution method on it now:
		Step-1:(For every used cells forming equations:-(Ui + Vj = Cij)
			Ua + v1 = 12
			Ua + V2 = 13
			Ub + V2 =  4
			Uc + V3 = 12
			Uc + V4 =  4
		Total Unknowns:  Ua,Ub,Uc,V1,V2,V3, and V4
	Let Ua=0;
	then 
	From equ:1     V1=12     //Ua=0
	From equ:2     V2=13     //Ua=0
	From equ:3     Ub=-9	//V2=13
	From equ:4     Uc= 	//here we are stuck because of degenracy as we see=> no of total unknowns > no of total equations
		//to overcome it we will introduce an artificial used cell let its B3(A.U.T)
			So we will also make its equation:
		Ub + V3 = 10
		so we get :-
			V3=19  //Ub=-9
	Now:-
	From equ:4     Uc= -7    //V3=19
	From equ:5     V4= 11   //Uc=-7			//and hence we become able to find the values of these two because of adding an
							//artificial used cell i.e (B3)



ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM:
==================
    =>Special Type of LP problem where objective is to minimize cost or time of completing a number of jobs by a number of persons.
Example:
	Assign the four tasks to four operators:
		Cost Matrix is given below:-
	
			operators
		=======================
		1      2      3      4

	A	20     28     19     13	
(Tasks)	B	15     30     31     28			
	C	40     21     20     17	
	D	21     28     26     12					

Hungarian Method:
================
	=>It is used to solve assignment Problems.

Step-1:	If in a given problem the no of rows is not equal to no of columns then the matrix is not a square matrix then the problem is
		is an unbalanced assignment problem(AP) then we will resolve it just like we did in solving unbalanced Transportation 
		problem(i.e by adding dummy row/column) to convert it into a balanced problem.				
				
	=>Since the given cost matrix is already a square matrix i.e no of rows= no of columns o no need to add imaginary(dummy) row/column.

Step-2: Row Reduction:
	==============
	i.e : Find smallest cost element in each row of cost matrix then subtract from each cost the main cost in same row.

	Elements in 1st row: 
			20     28     19     13
	Smallest=13 that is in A4 column: so we will do like this now:
		20 - 13 = 7
		28 - 13 = 15
		19 - 13 = 6
		13 - 13 = 0

	Elements in 2nd row: 
			15     30     31     28	
	Smallest=15 that is in A1 column: so we will do like this now:
		15 - 15 = 0
		30 - 15 = 15
		31 - 15 = 16
		28 - 15 = 13	

	Elements in 3rd row: 
			40     21     20     17
	Smallest=17 that is in A4 column: so we will do like this now:
		40 - 17 = 23
		21 - 17 = 4
		20 - 17 = 3
		17 - 17 = 0	

	Elements in 4th row: 
			21     28     26     12	
	Smallest=12 that is in A4 column: so we will do like this now:
		21 - 12 = 9
		28 - 12 = 16
		26 - 12 = 14
		12 - 12 = 0	

	So the new Cost matrix becomes :-
		7  15 6  0
		0  15 16 13
		23 4  3  0
		9  16 14 0

==========
	
Step-3:  Column-Reduction:
	=>Find the Min element in each column of cost matrix, subtract from each cost the min cost in its column.

	Element in 1st Column:
		7  
		0  
		23
		9  
	Smallest element= 0;
	so now:
		7-0=  7
		0-0=  0
		23-0=23
		9-0=  9


	Element in 2nd Column:
		  15
		  15 
		  4  
		  16
	Smallest element= 4;
	so now:
		15-4=  11
		15-4=  11
		4-4=   0
		16-4=  12


	Element in 3rd Column:
		 6  
		 16 
		 3  
		 14  
	Smallest element= 3;
	so now:
		6-3=  3
		16-3= 13
		3-3=  0
		14-3= 11


	Element in 4th Column:
		  0
		 13
		  0
		  0
	Smallest element= 0;
	so now:
		0-0=  0
		13-0= 13
		0-0=  0
		0-0=  0

	So the new Cost matrix becomes :-
		7  11 3  0
		0  11 13 13
		23 0  0  0
		9  12 11 0


Step-4: Check if matrix is reduced:
	=>Draw minimum number of lines necessary to cover all zeros.

		|7  11 3  0 |
		|0  11 13 13|
		|___________|				// | = vertical line
		|23 0  0  0 |				//-----=horizontal line				
		|9  12 11 0 |


	//as we see nof of minimum lines to cover all zeros =3
		7  11 3  0_|
		___________|
		0  11 13 13|
		___________|				// | = vertical line
		23 0  0  0 |				//-----=horizontal line				
		9  12 11 0 |

	//as we see nof of minimum lines to cover all zeros =3 so this is also correct we can do like this too;
	

Step-5: Check if matrix is reduced:
	If Number of lines drawn= order of matrix, then matrix is reduced hence locate the optimal solution(step-8)
	but if the matrix is not reduced go to step-6 i.e further reduction.
	
	As we see the minimum no of lines =3 =nol (no of lines)
		and order =4 x4=> 4 =nor(no of rows x no of cols)

	since nol < nor (3 < 4) hence the given matrix is not reduced.

Step-6: Further Reduction:
	=>Take smallest element of matrix that is not covered by single line , which is 3 here. Subtract 3 from all other values
		that are not covered and add 3 at the intersection of lines. leave values which are covered by single line.
		Following table shows the details.


		|7  11 3  0 |
		|0  11 13 13|
		|___________|				// | = vertical line
		|23 0  0  0 |				//-----=horizontal line				
		|9  12 11 0 |


	Uncovered Cells/entries= A2(11), B2(11), D2(12), A3(3), B3(13), D3(11)
	SO minimum entry in the matrix that is not covered by lines= A3(3) //having 3 value
	So we will now subtract A3(3) from all other uncovered entries:
		A2  11-3=8
		B2  11-3=8
		D2  12-3=9
		A3  3-3=0
		B3  13-3=10
		D3  11-3=8

	And we will add 3 in intersection points(entries): C1(23), C4(0)
		C1  23+3=26
		C4   0+3=3

=>So the new Cost matrix becomes :-
		7  8  0  0
		0  8 10 13
		26 0  0  3
		9  9  8  0

Step-7:To check if matrix is reduced or not, by drawing lines.

		7  8  0  0
		__________
		0  8 10 13
		__________
		26 0  0  3
		__________
		9  9  8  0
		__________

	=>as we see the no of lines = order hence matrix is reduced. //in case if it still gets not reduced then we would have 
									repaeted step-6 again

Step-8:
	=> Assign the tasks to the operators. Select a row that has a single zero and assign by squaring it. Strike off remaining 
		zeros if any in that row or column. Repeat the assignment for other tasks. Final assignment is shown in table 
		below:
		
=>Cost matrix :-
			operators
		=======================
		1      2      3      4

	A	7      8      0      0
(Tasks)	B	0      8     10     13
	C	26     0      0      3
	D	9      9      8      0

	//where there is zero :>indicates that this can be the possible assignment
	Therefore:
		=>Task A can be assigned to operator 3 or 4.		
		=>Task B can be assigned to operator 1.	
		=>Task C can be assigned to operator 2 or 3.	
		=>Task D can be assigned to operator 4.	
			//as operator 1 & 4 are already assigned to taskB & D respectively we will now don't consider these operators further.
			=>So now for Task A possible operators are 3 & 4 as we have not to consider operator 4 so 
			we will assign TAsk A to operator 3. 
			=>So now for Task C possible operators are 2 & 3 as we have not to consider operator 3 so 
			we will assign TAsk C to operator 2. 

Original Cost Matrix:
		
			operators
		=======================
		1      2      3      4

	A	20     28     19     13	
(Tasks)	B	15     30     31     28			
	C	40     21     20     17	
	D	21     28     26     12					


NOw we will calculate the total cost of tasks assigned to the corresponding operators keeping this original cost matrix in mind:
	Task    OPerator  Cost
	----------------------
	 A	  3	    19
	 B	  1	    15
	 C        2	    21
	 D        4	    12
        -----------------------
	Total Cost:     Rs. 67.00

Solving Maximization Assignment Problems:
=========================================

  Note:>Previous was MInimization problem and here also all steps are same except following differences:
=>Calculating equivalent cost matrix
=>Subtract each entry in the column fom the maximum entry in that column.

Example:(profit matrix is given below):

			Territory
(SalesMan) 	  1	    2		3

	   A	  40	    30		20
	   B      18	    28		22
	   C      12	    16		20
	   D	  25        24		27

Subtract each entry in the column fom the maximum entry in that column.
	column-1:   largest element=40
	40-40=0
	40-18=22
	40-12=28	
	40-25=15	
		
		
	column-2:   largest element=30
	30-30=0
	30-28=2
	30-16=14
	30-24=6		
			
	column-3:   largest element=27
	27-20=7
	27-22=18
	27-20=20
	27-27=13


	new profit matrix:
		0  	10  	20
		22 	12  	18
		28 	24  	20	
		15 	16  	13	
AS this matrix is unbalanced we will add a dummy column here to balance it:
			
	new profit matrix:
		0  	10  	20	0
		22 	12  	18	0
		28 	24  	20	0
		15 	16  	13	0

Rest Steps are same as in Minimization Problem.
